- ADD broker total message counts to the collection and UI

- LOG collected metrics

- UI reorder destinations by activity level


- Unit testing
	- Add Java unit testing
	- Add UI unit testing

- REST
	- Verify operation of REST calls against the REST standard.

- Event Notifications
	- Change event handlers to reduce the numbers of thread pools; one thread pool per bridge is too much.
	- Change the QueueBridge to use a synchronous listener model since the calls are known to be handled quickly.
	- Limit the rate of statistics updates to the UI.

- UI enhancements and fixes
	- Update the moving average statistics even when there is no activity. [COMPLETE]
	- Correct the bridge active state at UI startup.
	- Correct the bridge statistics at UI startup.
	- Improve look-and-feel of the filter bar.
	- Improve the active/inactive indicator.
	- Fix: making window too narrow causes the left-hand panel to take over the screen.

- ActiveMQ Functionality
	- Add Topics. [COMPLETE]
	- Support JMSReplyTo handling.
	- Shutdown bridges on service shutdown.  Lingering ActiveMQ threads prevent Tomcat shutdown completion.
	- Add Connection Listeners and Transport Listeners to report low level events and cleanup properly.

- Persistence
	- Add a means to persist the list of bridges.
	- TO CONSIDER: UI save and load feature to user's machine (json file?)
	- TO CONSIDER: pluggable persistence (JPA?)

- Cleanup
	- Comments
	- Remove unused code
	- Organize code better (especially the controllers.js script.  Modularize more and better)
